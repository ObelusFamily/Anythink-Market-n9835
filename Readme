So first thingâ€™s first - install Docker according to your machine it is available for windows,mac,linux

you may need to restart your pc to start docker

Great! You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal:
  docker -v (shows version)
  docker-compose -v.

Then, run docker-compose up from the project(that you want to be working on) root directory to load it's files(say frontend,backend,other stuff).

If Docker is working correctly, the backend,frontend should be running.

That's it.

It looks like your environment is ready! ðŸ˜€
